As I am learning about algorithms using a couple resources, I am saving the things I have found interesting or
useful in [this repository][algo-repo].

One resource I have found particularly useful to get started and follow a more structured learning journey 
is Robert Sedgewick's algorithms classes on Coursera (e.g., [this one][coursera-sedgewick]).
